Welcome to the project!

There's three things included: data_fetcher, interface, model, and common. 
The first three are made to hold their respective "parts" of the project and common is for the code / models they all share.

Note that in the 'data_fetcher' there is the code for the proxy. However, note this is simply for reference and the actual code and CI/CD flows reside in a seperate github repo for ease of set up and security issues.

Happy coding!
